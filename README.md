> Graphviz editor & rendering app with live updating.

## Todos
- [x] Add about page - showing current version + some resource links
- [x] Fix exporting with pan & zoom (pan & zoom disabled at the moment)
- [x] Improve size calculation at Export settings (sometimes wrong size)
- [x] Push to ~~github pages~~ surge.sh
- [x] Add feature list to readme
- [ ] Add format selection setting (stored in localstorage) currently only dot rendering supported
- [x] Add download dot input text (see viz.js demo page)
- [ ] Add copy dot to clipboard
- [x] Add drafting feature - every new page will be automatically saved as draft + autosave (could be improved by reducing save freq. - at the moment every change will be save)
